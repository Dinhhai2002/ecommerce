# Cursor Rules for E-commerce Project

## Project Structure
- Follow the existing package structure:
  ```
  com.web.ecommerce/
  ├── controller/    # REST API endpoints
  ├── service/       # Business logic interfaces
  │   └── impl/      # Implementation of service interfaces
  ├── dao/           # Data Access Objects interfaces
  │   └── impl/      # Implementation of DAO interfaces
  ├── entity/        # Database entities
  ├── model/         # Domain models
  ├── request/       # Request DTOs
  ├── response/      # Response DTOs
  ├── security/      # Security configurations
  └── common/        # Utilities and common code
  ```

## Architecture Guidelines
- **Service Layer**: All business logic MUST be implemented in the Service layer (specifically in the impl package)
- **DAO Layer**: Only database interactions should be in the DAO layer, no business logic
- **Controller Layer**: Should only handle request/response mapping and delegating to services
- Follow the Interface-Implementation pattern for both Service and DAO layers
- All service interfaces should be in the service package and implementations in service/impl
- All DAO interfaces should be in the dao package and implementations in dao/impl

## SOLID Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each class should have only one reason to change
- Controllers should only handle HTTP requests/responses
- Services should contain business logic
- DAOs should only handle database operations
- Entities should only represent database tables
- DTOs should only transfer data

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
- Use interfaces for service and DAO layers
- Implement new features by extending existing classes rather than modifying them
- Use strategy pattern for different business logic implementations

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- When extending classes, ensure they can be used interchangeably
- Maintain contract of base classes in derived classes
- Use proper inheritance hierarchy

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use
- Create specific interfaces for different client needs
- Break down large interfaces into smaller, focused ones
- Keep service interfaces lean and focused

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules
- Both should depend on abstractions
- Use constructor injection for dependencies
- Avoid direct instantiation of dependencies

## Coding Standards

### Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for class names
- Use camelCase for method and variable names
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Prefix interfaces with 'I' (e.g., IUserService)
- Suffix DTOs with 'DTO' (e.g., UserDTO)
- Suffix entities with their domain name (e.g., User)
- Implementation classes should be suffixed with "Impl" (e.g., UserServiceImpl)

### Code Organization
- Keep methods small and focused (max 20 lines)
- Maximum 3 levels of nesting
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add proper documentation for public APIs

### Error Handling
- Use custom exceptions for business logic
- Handle exceptions at appropriate levels
- Log exceptions with proper context
- Return meaningful error messages to clients

### Security
- Never expose sensitive data in responses
- Use proper authentication and authorization
- Validate all input data
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Encrypt sensitive data

### Testing
- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Use mock objects for external dependencies
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage

### Database
- Use JPA annotations properly
- Implement proper relationships between entities
- Use appropriate data types
- Add indexes for frequently queried fields
- Use transactions where necessary

### API Design
- Follow RESTful conventions
- Use proper HTTP methods
- Version your APIs
- Document APIs using Swagger/OpenAPI
- Use proper status codes

### Performance
- Use proper caching strategies
- Optimize database queries
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Implement proper indexing
- Use async operations where appropriate

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Use Lombok to reduce boilerplate code
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Use design patterns appropriately
- Write clean, self-documenting code
- Regular code reviews

### Documentation
- Document all public APIs
- Add meaningful comments for complex logic
- Keep README up to date
- Document configuration changes
- Add proper JavaDoc comments

### Version Control
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Follow Git flow branching strategy
- Review code before merging
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Use proper branch naming conventions

### Logging
- Use appropriate log levels
- Log meaningful information
- Include proper context in logs
- Use structured logging
- Don't log sensitive information

### Configuration
- Use application.properties/yml for configuration
- Externalize configuration
- Use profiles for different environments
- Keep sensitive data in secure storage
- Use proper encryption for sensitive data
